# UK Vet Medicines Data Standards
Building open data standards for UK veterinary medicines data exchange based up [ICAR Animal Data Exchange standards](https://github.com/adewg/ICAR), an initiative led by the [BioSPüëÅ](http://www.biospi.org) Data Science Laboratory for One Health Epidemiology, Sensing and Omics at the University of Bristol.

We aim to develop concise, yet comprehensive standards for the interchange of records regarding the usage of veterinary medicines in livestock in the UK. If you are a researcher, developer, farmer, vet or any other interested party we welcome feedback on these efforts and any contributions.

## Components
[Summary proposal documents](https://github.com/biospi/UKVetMedicinesDataStandards/tree/master/Proposal%20Documents/Releases) are available which explain the scope, history and context of the project.

[Individual message specifications](https://github.com/biospi/UKVetMedicinesDataStandards/tree/master/Messages) in [Json-Schema](http://json-schema.org) format

Example [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specifications in both [yaml](https://github.com/biospi/UKVetMedicinesDataStandards/blob/master/openapi.yaml) and [json](https://github.com/biospi/UKVetMedicinesDataStandards/blob/master/openapi.json) formats. The example specifications are in a monolothic format where the full definition of all referenced schematic components (messages) are included within the API specification, as opposed to including them by reference to the json-schema formatted message definitions listed above. These specifications can be visualised using tools such as [swagger-ui](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) or [swagger-editor](https://editor.swagger.io/). 

## Releases
This repository contains publicly-available releases of the specification
